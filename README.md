Rotate array A, K times. This means that each element of the array
will be shifted to the right, K times. 


The array consists of N integers. Rotation means that each element is moved right by one index, and the last element becomes the first element. 

Given A = {3, 8, 9, 7, 6} and K = 3 the result of three rotations is 
	A = {9, 7, 6, 3, 8}
